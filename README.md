# Candor WordPress

## A WordPress theme for developers with Bootsrap 4
When I first started developing with WordPress, I looked long and far for a simple WordPress theme that made use of Bootstrap. Candor WordPress has the following features:

1. Bootstrap 4.2
2. Custom Navwalker so the Menu System works out of the box
3. Font Awesome 5 Integration
4. Google Font Integrations
5. Sticky footer
